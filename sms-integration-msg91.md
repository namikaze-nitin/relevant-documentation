# SMS Integration : MSG91

## Concepts
### Promotional Message

* Message sent with an objective of promoting product or services.
* These messages can only be send from 9AM to 9PM.
* Mesages can be send only to numbers that are not the DND numbers.

As a thumb rule, SMS which has details related to offers, coupons, etc can be considered fit for these type of messages.

### Transactional Message

* These are SMS's sent to your registered users.
* These contains information necessary for using the product or service.
* Ability to send messages to DND numbers.
* Delivering urgent information to people is possible with transactional Bulk SMS.
* Unlike promotional SMS which suffer from time constraint, these SMS can be sent at anytime, without any time constraint.

**Use** : Companies can send important notifications to the public. For example, Railways can use these Alert SMS for sending PNR status, banks and other financial institutions can notify people about the balance left in their account and can also intimate about other necessary information, educational institutions can utilize the transactional messaging service for sending urgent notifications to students and parents.

## Test Cases
### Method 1 : Using Online User Interface
For information related to online control panel [click here...](file:///home/ms/Desktop/sms-integration.md#introduction-to-msg91-user-interface)
#### Test Case 1 : Sending a simple Text message
* SMS Creation	
![ui-simple-sms](sms-integration-res/ui-simple-sms)
* SMS Cost : 1 Unit
* Delivery Report : Select `Delivery Report` from side menu. Here you will find all the delivery reports.
![delivery-report-menu](sms-integration-res/ui-delivery-report-menu)
You can see reports by clicking on a specific one.
![delivery-report-menu-sms](sms-integration-res/ui-delivery-report-menu-sms1)
![delivery-report-menu-sms](sms-integration-res/ui-delivery-report-menu-sms2)


#### Test Case 2 : Sending one SMS to multiple recipients 
* SMS Creation : Manually enter comma separated phone no's or add a group from phonebook.
![ui-multi-user-sms](sms-integration-res/ui-multi-user-sms)
* SMS Cost : No of recipients * Cost of single SMS.
* Delivery Report
![ui-delivery-report-menu-multi-user-sms](sms-integration-res/ui-delivery-report-menu-multi-user-sms1)

	* Since two messages are not yet delivered, you can see the change in graph.
	* Same changes are reflected back in the report.
	* User whose phone no is saved in phonebook, there name appears in reports.

#### Test Case 3 : Sending BULK SMS
Here goal is to send different SMS to different recipient.
* SMS Creation : `Send Custom SMS` menu from side bar.
	* Create a Excel sheet consisting of details of user phone no and message that is to be sent.
	* Convert this file to `.csv` format. 
	* Go to `Send Custom SMS` menu and upload the file. For sample of excel sheet format [click here..](sms-integration-res/custom-sms.csv)
	![ui-send-custom-sms](sms-integration-res/ui-send-custom-sms)
	* Create message as shown in pic below. Don't forget to select the column where user phone no's are present (column B here). For message content, select the columns which you want to include by clicking on `Select` button.

![ui-null-sms](sms-integration-res/ui-null-sms)
* SMS Cost : No cost as message will not be sent
* Delivery Report : No SMS report generated



### Method 2 : Using Java XML API
#### About XML API
* It is not possible for a URL to take too much data in GET method and have to use POST method
* It enables few extra features like sending custom SMS
* Sending 500 SMS will take 5 loop in HTTP API but none in XML, thus saving our resources

* Information that can be sent in a SMS

|XML node name|	Description|
|-|-|
|AUTHKEY *|	User authentication key|
|TEXT *|	It contains the URL encoded message content to send|
|SENDER *|	It contains sender ID|
|TO *|	It contain mobile numbers|
|SCHEDULE DATE TIME|	It contains scheduled date and time|
|FLASH|1|
|UNICODE|1|
|ROUTE|Route name if you have more than one route available in your account (eg. 4 for Transactional and 1 for Promotional)|
|CAMPAIGN|	It contains campaign name|
|COUNTRY|0 for international, 91 for India, 1 for USA|

> '*' marked data cannot be left blank

* Response : returns json response with success if all parameters are correct or error with appropriate error message.

|Response type	|	Response messages	|	Description	|
|-|-|-|
|success|XML code is correct|Returns success for validate XML API call|
|error|XML code should not be blank|Returns error in case of 'testingsXml' parameter is missing or empty|
|error|Specific error message|Returns error in case of ill constructed XML API and displays appropriate error message|

**Note** : Output will be request ID which is alphanumeric and contains 24 characters like mentioned above. With this request ID, delivery Report can be viewed. If request not sent sucessfully, you will get the appropriate error message.

#### Sample base code for test cases
* Create a class and define a function (here `hitUrl()`) to handle SMS sending. This function will be same for all the test cases in examples mentioned here for reference:
```
public static String hitUrl(String urlToHit, String param)
	{
    	try
    	{
            URL url = new URL(urlToHit);
            HttpURLConnection http = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
            http.setDoOutput(true);
            http.setDoInput(true);
            http.setRequestMethod("POST");

            DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(http.getOutputStream());
            wr.writeBytes(param);
            // use wr.write(param.getBytes("UTF-8")); for unicode message's instead of wr.writeBytes(param);

            wr.flush();
            wr.close();
            http.disconnect();

            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(http.getInputStream()));
            String inputLine;
            if ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null)
            {       in.close();
                    return inputLine;
            }else{
                    in.close();
                    return "-1";
            }
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println("Exception Caught..!!!");
            e.printStackTrace();
            return "-2";
        }
    }
``` 

* Create a function (here `main()`) to handle different type of data which will be sent. This function will be slightly different for every test case.
```
public static void main(String...s){
		String strUrl = "https://control.msg91.com/api/postsms.php";

		//message to be sent will be added here
		String xmlData = "";	

	String output = SendSMS.hitUrl(strUrl, xmlData);
	System.out.println("Output is: "+output);		
}
```
**Note** : We will be changing content of `xmlData` variable in test cases below.


#### Test Case 1 : Sending a simple text SMS
* SMS Creation : `main()` function will pass message in `xml` form to `hitUrl()` which will send this message. Update variable( here `xmlData`) containing actual SMS content as follows in `main()` function. 
```
String xmlData="data="
				+ "<MESSAGE>"
				+ "		<AUTHKEY>173688AEUZr5aqK59b25cb5</AUTHKEY>"
				+ "		<ROUTE>4</ROUTE>"
				+ "		<SMS TEXT='Hello Nitin' FROM='MuseNi'>"
				+ "			<ADDRESS TO='9999999999'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "		</SMS>"
				+ "</MESSAGE>";
```
* SMS Cost : 1 Unit
* Returned Response : `Output is: 37696e6f3670313535303730`

Since message sending was successful, API will return a alphanumeric `request Id` (here `37696e6f3670313535303730`) which can then be used to track our delivery reports.

#### Test Case 2 : Sending one SMS to multiple recipients
* SMS Creation : Update variable( here `xmlData`) containing actual SMS content as follows in `main()` function. 
```
String xmlData = "data="
				+ "<MESSAGE>"
				+ "		<AUTHKEY>173688AEUZr5aqK59b25cb5</AUTHKEY>"
				+ "		<ROUTE>4</ROUTE>"
				+ " 	<SCHEDULEDATETIME>2016-03-31 11:17:39 </SCHEDULEDATETIME>"
				+ "		<SMS TEXT='Hello Nitin' FROM='MuseNi'>"
				+ "			<ADDRESS TO='987*******'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "			<ADDRESS TO='940*******'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "		</SMS>"
				+ "</MESSAGE>";
```
* SMS Cost : No of recipients * cost of 1 SMS
* Returned Response : `Output is: 37696e707643323435353835`

Since message sending was successful, API will return a alphanumeric `request Id` which can then be used to track our delivery reports.

#### Test Case 3 : Sending Bulk SMS
Here goal is to send different SMS to different recipient.
* SMS Creation : Update variable( here `xmlData`) containing actual SMS content as follows in `main()` function.
```
String xmlData = "data="
				+ "<MESSAGE>"
				+ "<AUTHKEY>173688AEUZr5aqK59b25cb5</AUTHKEY>"
				+ "<ROUTE>4</ROUTE>"
				+ "	<SMS TEXT='Hello Team Back-end' FROM='MuseNi'>"
				+ "		<ADDRESS TO='987*******'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "		<ADDRESS TO='940*******'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "	</SMS>"
				+ "	<SMS TEXT='Hello Team Front-End' FROM='MuseNi'>"
				+ "		<ADDRESS TO='798*******'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "		<ADDRESS TO='832*******'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "	</SMS>"
				+ "</MESSAGE>";
```
* SMS Cost : No of recipients * cost of 1 SMS
* Returned Response : `Output is: 37696e704a58363537373030`

Since message sending was successful, API will return a alphanumeric `request Id` which can then be used to track our delivery reports.

#### Test Case 4 : Sending SMS with NULL('') message
* SMS Creation : Update variable (here `xmlData`) containing actual SMS content as follows in `main()` function.
```
String xmlData = "data="
				+ "<MESSAGE>"
				+ "<AUTHKEY>173688AEUZr5aqK59b25cb5</AUTHKEY>"
				+ "<ROUTE>4</ROUTE>"
				+ "	<SMS TEXT='' FROM='MuseNi'>"
				+ "		<ADDRESS TO='987*******'></ADDRESS>"
				+ "	</SMS>"
				+ "</MESSAGE>";
```
* SMS Cost : No Cost
* Returned Response : `Output is: 37696e70376e353237353634`

API will return a alphanumeric `request Id` which can then be used to track our delivery reports.

Here Since there is not any syntax problem, message request will be successful from API. But when we open `Delivery Report` menu from online user Interface of MSG91, it will show `API failed : check`.
![API failed](sms-integration-res/api-failed-using-ui)

On Clicking `check`, we will see `Failed API` tab showing `Reason` for not delivery of sms as `missing message`.
![API Failed](sms-integration-res/api-failed-using-ui-report)

#### Test Case 5 : Sending SMS with NULL('') Phone No
* SMS Creation : Update variable (here `xmlData`) containing actual SMS content as follows in `main()` function.
```
String xmlData = "data="
				+ "<MESSAGE>"
				+ "<AUTHKEY>173688AEUZr5aqK59b25cb5</AUTHKEY>"
				+ "<ROUTE>4</ROUTE>"
				+ "	<SMS TEXT='screw you : no phone' FROM='MuseNi'>"
				+ "		<ADDRESS TO=''></ADDRESS>"
				+ "	</SMS>"
				+ "</MESSAGE>";
```

* SMS Cost : No Cost
* Returned Response : `Output is: code: 202`

Since we have a blank field (phone no) here, we will recieve an error of code 202.
> code 202 : Invalid mobile number. You must have entered either less than 10 digits or there is an alphabetic character in the mobile number field in API.

				+ "	</SMS>"
				+ "</MESSAGE>";
```
* SMS Cost : No Cost
* Returned Response : `Output is: 37696e715968343538343637`
